# 2016 summer Neuroimaging course

This is the [schedule](https://fmrif.nimh.nih.gov/public/fmri-course/index_html) for 2016 summer Neuroimaging course in NIH.

There are some previous
[materials](https://fmrif.nimh.nih.gov/public/fmri-course/fmri-course-summer-2015) can be download.


## A brief history of Neuroimaging
1. lesion based research
2. x-ray (1895), CT (1971),
    * Sir Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur (1973),
    * Damadian, human-sized scanner
3. hemodynamic metobolic imaging
4. EEG
5. functional mri

**Five key factors for neuroImaging**

1. magnetic properties of bloodï¼Œ sensitive contrast, Ogawa predicted FMRI but got the sign wrong.
2. The first funtional MRI result (MGH),T2 weighted images
3. Local vasodilatation( not clearly known)->increase in capillary and venous blood oxygenation-> T2 and T2*
4.  single shot Echo planar imaging (EPI), T2* decay 20~40 ms
5.  MGH,Minnesota,WCM
6.  Perfusion imaging
7.  MRFN(Magnetic Resonance Functional Neuroimaging),1993 NIH 4T
8. optical imaging
9. Yacoub et al. PNAS 2008, orientation columns in Human V1 as revealed by fmri at 7T
10. huber et al layer dependent activity
11. M.S. Beauchamp et al, Multi-sensory integration
12. MRI (multi-shot) VS fmri (sigle-shot)
13. multi-band
prevalence of MRI scanners

Functional contrast
Blood Volume Imaging
T2* and T2
T2* = 50 ms or 48 ms
Contrast at 3T is higher that 1.5
Spin-Echo VS Gradient-Echo

Hemodynamic Specificity

## Perfusion imaging

* perfusion better than BOLD for long duration activation

* perfusion last longer than BOLD

* base line of perfusion is stable
